# LeetCode Solutions Tracker  

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Tracker** repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, categorized by their problem numbers and names. The solutions are written in **TypeScript** and synced automatically using the LeetCode Tracker extension.  

## 🛠️ Features  

- **Comprehensive Problem Solutions**: Each solution is implemented in TypeScript with clear and concise code.  
- **Automatic Updates**: Solutions are automatically pushed to this repository whenever I solve a new problem on LeetCode.  
- **Organized Structure**: Problems are stored in folders named after their LeetCode problem number and title.  
- **Readable Code**: Code is well-documented to ensure clarity and understanding.
